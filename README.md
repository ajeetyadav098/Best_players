- So we wanted to efficiently assemble a championship-winning T20 cricket team by leveraging advanced analytics and player statistics. Traditional selection methods lack precision and data-driven insights, hindering optimal team composition and strategic decision-making. A systematic approach is needed to maximize performance and gain a competitive edge in the dynamic world of T20.
- To make this project a success, we collected the data from "www.espncricinfo.com" and used web scraping to extract data from this website.
- After cleaning and processing the data using python, we used Power BI to make interactive and dynamic visualization to correctly chose the players for team, and to do that we also brought DAX funtions to work.
- Finally we chose the best players to make an ultimate team.
